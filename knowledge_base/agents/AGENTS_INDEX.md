# Agents Index

This file catalogs agents **registered for SSE runs** in `server/routes/agents.js`, the **interactive conversation** stack in `server/routes/conversation.js`, and **demo catalog** entries in `server/demo/demoCatalog.js`. Authoritative wiring is always the source files; this index can lag — update it when you add a notable agent.

**Demo catalog only:** `web-intelligence` and `conversation-assistant` appear in `DEMO_CATALOG` but do not yet have matching `createAgentRoute` registrations in `agents.js` (placeholders for future demo pages).

## Platform quality gate (all agents)

Edits that touch **`createAgentRoute`**, **`AgentScheduler`**, **`markdownPdfBuffer`**, **`server/routes/export`**, **`promptVersions.js`**, or the **tender** agent entry file affect **every** SSE-registered agent and demo that relies on that spine. **Run `npm test` from the repository root** (after `cd server && npm install`) before finishing such a change — see [PROJECT_IDENTITY.md](../../PROJECT_IDENTITY.md) (*Quality gate*), [server/CLAUDE.md](../../server/CLAUDE.md), and [scripts/smoke/README.md](../../scripts/smoke/README.md).

Every new model-backed agent or AI routine must also be covered by the Lessons Repository. Use `createAgentRoute` for manual SSE agents and `AgentScheduler` for scheduled agents so write-back wiring is automatic. If the routine bypasses those platform paths with a custom route or direct provider call, add a local `proposeLessonFromRun` call after the successful result is saved or returned. `proposeLessonFromRun` should receive a reusable lesson/pattern, not a run log. Update `LESSON_COVERAGE_SECTIONS` in `client/src/pages/admin/AdminLessonsPage.jsx` at the same time so the Admin > Lessons & Rules coverage link remains current.

Every model-backed agent must also use the platform model resolver. Prefer the resolved `adminConfig` passed by `createAgentRoute` / `AgentScheduler`; otherwise call `AgentConfigService.getResolvedAdminConfig(slug, orgId)`. A blank per-agent model means `Use organisation default`. Do not add hardcoded runtime model fallbacks such as `?? 'claude-sonnet-4-6'` or `|| 'deepseek-chat'`.

## Agent architecture patterns

### Pre-fetch pattern

Used by: `wp-theme-extractor`, most fixed-sequence Ads/CRM report agents (see `server/CLAUDE.md` — pre-fetch section).

- Data fetched in Node before the model call
- `maxIterations: 1`, `tools: []` for the main Claude pass

### ReAct pattern

Used by: `google-ads-conversation`

- Claude with MCP tool definitions; `AgentOrchestrator.run()` loop

### Two-model (vision / extraction → synthesis)

Used by: `demo-document-analyzer`, stages of `spec-validator` / `demo-spec-validator` (with Python between), `demo-tender-response` (with deterministic compliance between extraction and synthesis)

- Extraction/vision: `adminConfig.model` (must be vision-capable when reading PDFs/images)
- Synthesis: resolved organisation default, falling back to the extraction model only when the same resolved admin config has already supplied it
- **Never** hardcode model ID fallbacks — see `server/CLAUDE.md` and `DEMO-AGENTS.md`

### Three-stage (extract → deterministic code → synthesise)

Used by: `spec-validator`, `demo-spec-validator`

- Stage 2 must stay non-shell (`execFileAsync`, no `shell: true`)

### Four-stage (demo tender)

Used by: `demo-tender-response`

- Deterministic compliance in Python subprocess; HITL per requirement
